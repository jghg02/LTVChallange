## Description 
This repo contains the proposed solution for the ios challenge. 

## Design patterns. 

For the solution we used MVVM together with the coordinator pattern. With this we manage everything related to navigation within the app in a simple way. 
At the moment of starting the app a Tab Bar is shown that contains all the screens that were implemented. 


For each screen interaction `MVVM` was used. 

Everything related to the networking part was implemented with a Swift Package Manager developed by me called `JNetworking` which is published on GitHub and is still under development.

## Google API Key 

To add the google api key you must do it inside the App Delegate of the project.
